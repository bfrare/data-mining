            "Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 25 films since.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (later known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, at the age of 56, with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of Apple. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n"

Sanctioned by the International Skating Union (ISU), the World Championships are considered the most prestigious event in figure skating.[1] Medals were awarded in men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance. The competition determined the entry quotas for each skating federation at the 2022 World Championships and was the first qualifying event for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n",

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and assessed the outbreak as having become a pandemic on March 11, 2020.[2]\n",

            "COVID‑19 transmission occurs when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over long distances, particularly indoors. People can remain contagious for up to twenty days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms themselves.[3] Several COVID-19 vaccines were approved and distributed, many of which initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures included social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, use of face masks or coverings in public, covering coughs and sneezes, and hand washing.[4] One testing method to see if a person was infected with COVID-19 was real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR),[5] which was used at the 2021 World Championships.[6]\n",

Emily Bausback of Canada stated: \"I knew we wouldn't be going if it wasn't safe... I feel comfortable with the situation.\"[29] Elizaveta Tuktamysheva of Russia expressed no hesitation about competing at the World Championships, having already had COVID-19.[30]\n",

A negative PCR test was required within forty-eight hours of arrival in Sweden, with a series of follow-up tests scheduled afterward.

A focal point of criticism was the decision to hold the traditional post-competition banquet, where many skaters were documented not wearing masks or socially distancing at all, as well as sharing food from a communal buffet.[33] Additionally, a large number of Russian skaters had contracted COVID-19 during the season, including Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, Victoria Sinitsina, and Nikita Katsalapov.[34][35] Nevertheless, all members of the Russian delegation tested negative during the initial round of testing administered upon arrival in Stockholm.[36]\n",

            "Attendees at the competition remained in a bubble throughout the event.[17] On March 22, the ISU announced that one positive case had been found during one of the initial rounds of testing and that contact tracing procedures were being undertaken.[40] The skater with the positive case, later revealed to be Viktoriia Safonova of Belarus, was quarantined and not allowed to compete. Safonova's coach subsequently tested negative in a second round of testing, and Safonova, who had traveled to Stockholm from a different location, had had no contact with the other members of the Belarusian team or their coaches.[41] On March 24, the ISU announced that a second positive case had been found during the initial round of testing. Without accreditation, neither skater with positive test results had been allowed into the competition bubble.[42]\n",
            "\n",
            "On March 26, the ISU announced that a third positive case had been found, this time within the bubble.[43] After the event, Simon Proulx-Sénécal of Armenia revealed that he had tested positive on March 25, the day before the ice dance competition was scheduled to start, and asked for a re-test prior to the rhythm dance segment on March 26. As the test result did not come back until after the rhythm dance had concluded, Proulx-Sénécal and his partner, Tina Garabedian, were not allowed to compete. The result came back as a second positive. Proulx-Sénécal expressed that he believed his first test was a false positive, as his federation later received a written test result stating that his second test, taken the morning of the rhythm dance, was negative, not positive as initially conveyed to their team doctor.[44] He subsequently tested negative twice more, once the day after the rhythm dance (March 27) and again upon returning to Montreal on March 29.[45]\n",
